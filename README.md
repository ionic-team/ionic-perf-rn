# ionic-perf-rn

In an attempt to dive deeper into the performance metrics of both Ionic React and React Native, we've built competing apps that showcase the same features. The results of these tests can be found [on our blog](https://ionic.link/3uofp1d).

While we recognize that further optimizations might be possible, we tried to keep both environments as close to the default experience as possible. This was to ensure that we replicate what a typical developer would experience when building an app for the first time with both platforms.
